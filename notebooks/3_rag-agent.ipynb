    "In this notebook we will build a [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) agent capable of answering questions about specific source information/documents. This agent will use a technique known as [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/rag/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases. RAG addresses a key limitation of models: models rely on fixed training datasets, which can lead to outdated or incomplete information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a query:\n",
    "1. RAG systems first search a knowledge base for relevant information\n",
    "2. The system then incorporates this retrieved information into the model's prompt\n",
    "3. The model uses the provided context to generate a response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By bridging the gap between vast language models and dynamic, targeted information retrieval, RAG is a powerful technique for building more capable and reliable AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "1. **Ingestion** or **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "2. **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model."

    "The ingestion/indexing process follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Load: First we need to load our data. Since we are working with a PDF file, we will use [LangChain's PyPDFLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.pdf.PyPDFLoader.html) to parse the PDF file content.\n",
    "    >If you want to load other file types, you can explore [LangChain's repository of document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) or simply use [LangChain's DirectoryLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_directory/), which is a simple interface that allows us to load a range of file types out-of-the-box.\n",
    "2. Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window. We will use [LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/#text-structured-based) to split the documents.\n",
    "3. Embed and Store: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model. In this notebook, we will use [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma), a simple and easy-to-use open-source embedding database.\n",
