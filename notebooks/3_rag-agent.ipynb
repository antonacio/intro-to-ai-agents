    "In this notebook we will build a [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) agent capable of answering questions about specific source information/documents. This agent will use a technique known as [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/rag/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases. RAG addresses a key limitation of models: models rely on fixed training datasets, which can lead to outdated or incomplete information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a query:\n",
    "1. RAG systems first search a knowledge base for relevant information\n",
    "2. The system then incorporates this retrieved information into the model's prompt\n",
    "3. The model uses the provided context to generate a response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By bridging the gap between vast language models and dynamic, targeted information retrieval, RAG is a powerful technique for building more capable and reliable AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "1. **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "2. **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model."

    "The indexing process follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Load: First we need to load our data. Since we are working with a PDF file, we will use [LangChain's PyPDFLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.pdf.PyPDFLoader.html) to parse the PDF file content.\n",
    "    >If you want to load other file types, you can explore [LangChain's repository of document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) or simply use [LangChain's DirectoryLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_directory/), which is a simple interface that allows us to load a range of file types out-of-the-box.\n",
    "2. Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window. We will use [LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/#text-structured-based) to split the documents.\n",
    "3. Embed and Store: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model. In this notebook, we will use [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma), a simple and easy-to-use open-source embedding database.\n",

They supersede any prior agreements.\\nWe don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered\\nby these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses and organizations,\\nand other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using\\nour Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to\\nyou and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which person‐\\nalized ads to show you.\\nWe don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that\\ndirectly identiﬁes you (such as your name, email address or other contact informa‐\\ntion) with advertisers unless you give us speciﬁc permission. Instead, advertisers\\ncan tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show\\nthose ads to people who may be interested.

You\\ncan also go to your settings pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to re‐\\nview the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.\\nWhat Products do these Terms cover?\\n1. The services we provide\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world clos‐\\ner together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services de‐\\nscribed below to you:\\n1.1 Provide a personalized experience for you:\\nYour experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories,\\nevents, ads, and other content you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to\\nthe Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as\\nFacebook Marketplace, and search. For example, we use data about the connec‐\\ntions you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on\\nand off our Products - to personalize your experience.\\n1.2 Connect you with people and organizations you care\\nabout:\\nWe help you ﬁnd and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and\\nothers that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make\\nsuggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend,\\nFacebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you\\nmay want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and\\nwe believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people,\\ngroups, and organizations they care about.\\n1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate\\nabout what matters to you:\\nThere are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends,\\nfamily, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates,\\nphotos, videos, and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings),\\nsending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, cre‐\\nating events or groups, or adding content to your proﬁle as well as showing you in‐\\nsights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and con‐\\ntinue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality\\nand 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta\\nProducts.\"),\n",

Section\\n2 below explains this in more detail.\\n1.5 Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our ser‐\\nvices, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of\\nusers safe:\\nPeople will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We\\nwork hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity,\\nand conﬁdentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams\\naround the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant\\nentities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our\\nProducts, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to\\nhelp support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of poten‐\\ntially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we may take appro‐\\npriate action based on our assessment that may include - notifying you, offering\\nhelp, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling\\nan account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data across Meta Companies\\nwhen we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products\\nor to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we\\nshare information with Meta Companies that provide ﬁnancial products and services\\nto help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law.\\nMeta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you\\nwhere it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more\\ninformation, please review our Privacy Policy.\\nIn some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms\\nand bylaws. Learn more here.\\n1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe\\nand functional services for everyone:\\nWe use and develop advanced technologies - such as artiﬁcial intelligence, machine\\nlearning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products\\nsafely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology\\nlike this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in\\nphotos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated net‐\\nwork and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in\\nareas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability\\nto detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community\\nand the integrity of our Products.\\n1.7 Research ways to make our services better:'),\n",

How our services are funded\\nInstead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by\\nusing the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you\\npersonalized ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and\\norganizations pay us to promote on and off Meta Company Products. We use your\\npersonal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you\\npersonalized ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.\\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalized ads\\nsystem. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling\\nadvertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to\\ntell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their\\nads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show\\ntheir ad to people who we think might be interested.\\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help\\nthem understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta\\nProducts. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to\\nadvertisers to help them better understand their audience, like the fact that women\\nbetween the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering\\nhave seen an ad. We don’t share information that directly identiﬁes you (information\\nsuch as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or\"),\n",

For this reason, you must:\\nProvide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.\\nProvide accurate information about yourself.\\nCreate only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.\\nNot share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or\\ntransfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\\nWe try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use\\nFacebook if:\\nYou are under 13 years old.\\nYou are a convicted sex offender.\\nWe've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the\\nCommunity Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of\\nFacebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the Community\\nStandards, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account\\nwithout our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided\\nat our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was\\nwrong or without cause.\\nYou are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under ap‐\\nplicable laws.\\n3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products\\nWe want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content\\nthat is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of oth‐\\ners or the integrity of our community.

Permission to use content you create and share: Speciﬁcally, when you share,\\npost, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in con‐\\nnection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licens‐\\nable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy,\\npublicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content\\n(consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that\\nif you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share\\nit with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service\\nproviders that support those products and services. This license will end when your\\ncontent is deleted from our systems.\\n3. Deleting Your Content: You can delete individual content you share, post, and\\nupload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be\\ndeleted if you delete your account. Learn more about how to delete your account.\\nAccount deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of\\na page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in\\nShared Albums which may continue to be visible to other album members.\\nIt may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account deletion\\nprocess or receive a content deletion request. If you send content to trash, the dele‐\\ntion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you chose to delete the con‐\\ntent sooner.
